# LAMP Stack Documentation Website
This is an example of a documentation website I made during my second semester in college. This was a real project I was assigned to in one of my courses, but the requirements were only to do the documentation, without emphasis on the website itself. 

I decided to use it as an opportunity to learn new technologies and for personal growth, so I dedicated many hours to create a good website with some cool navigation mechanics as well as used a framework for the first time: Tailwind CSS.
